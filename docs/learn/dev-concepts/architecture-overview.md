This section outlines Prysm's various internal components and their role in the client.

## Prysm client components

When a Prysm client is initialized out of the box, it starts a variety of services that run in parallel to handle everything required for the life cycle of the beacon chain. In no particular order, Prysm includes:

* A [**beacon node**](/learn/dev-concepts/prysm-beacon-node.md) which powers the beacon chain at the core of Ethereum consensus.
* A [**validator client**](/learn/dev-concepts/prysm-validator-client.md) connects to the beacon node and manages staking keypairs.
* A [**public RPC server**](/apis/prysm-public-api.md) to request data about network state, blocks, validators etc.
* A [**persistent key-value store**](/learn/dev-concepts/boltdb-database.md) in the form of a database ([BoltDB](/learn/dev-concepts/boltdb-database.md)).
* A [**P2P networking framework and server**](/learn/dev-concepts/p2p-networking.md) to connect with other beacon nodes.
* **Monitoring and metrics gathering technologies** [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) and [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io) track everything that's happening across beacon nodes in the network.

## Prysm client functionality

Ethereum proof-of-stake is coordinated by a consensus chain known as the beacon chain. This beacon chain serves as a mechanism to manage a set of [Proof-of-Stake](/terminology.md#proof-of-stake-pos) [validators](/terminology.md#validator) and to drive consensus over the [execution chain](/terminology.md#execution-layer).

The execution chain stores blocks containing user-generated transactions such as token transfers and smart contracts. Rather than the originally-proposed execution shards, Ethereum now scales data availability for rollups through blob-carrying transactions (introduced by EIP-4844 in the Deneb/Dencun upgrade and scaled further by PeerDAS in the Fulu/Fusaka upgrade). Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus provides a massive improvement over proof-of-work.

The beacon chain runs through a distributed network of nodes known as [beacon nodes](/learn/dev-concepts/prysm-beacon-node.md). Participants who want to run a beacon node and help secure the network can stake 32 `ETH` to have their [validator client](/learn/dev-concepts/prysm-validator-client.md) join the pool of validators, who are responsible for [proposing](../../terminology.md#proposal-propose) and [attesting](../../terminology.md#attestation-attest) to new blocks on the beacon chain. This deposit does not come out of nowhere; validators transfer Ether from the [execution](../../terminology.md#execution-layer) chain to the system using a [validator deposit contract](/learn/dev-concepts/validator-deposit-contract.md).

Each of these components and their roles in the Prysm client are explained within the following sections of this documentation. If you have any questions, please stop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qEZK94mFXP).
